# Model Card for omarmomen/babylm_bpe_tokenizer_32k

This model is part of the experiments in my master's thesis titled "Linguistic Structure Induction from Language Models" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09714).

"omarmomen/babylm_bpe_tokenizer_32k" is a RobertaTokenizer pretrained on the BabyLM 10 Training dataset (cased) with 32K tokens.
